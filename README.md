# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Olivia Dovernor

Iâ€™m a Technical Consultant at [Actica Consulting](https://www.actica.co.uk/), working across DevOps, data infrastructure, and public-sector transformation.

With a **PhD in Optics** and a **Masterâ€™s in Materials Chemistry**, Iâ€™m trained to solve complex problems through experimentation, structure, and systems thinking. My academic research focused on polymer imaging and the synthesis of porous materials:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“˜ **PhD** â€” *Fourier Light Field Microscopy for Polymer Networks*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“— **[MChem]** â€” *Mechanistic Study of the ADOR Process for Zeolites* ([ACS Publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.cgd.3c01037))
